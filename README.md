playsongs V1 for iOS - iPhone & iPad
=========

A sweet little illustrated iOS Audio app for Childrens music, that has never quite made it to the app store :(

I designed and built this iOS app to play some sweet music for my little boy. 
The sample files are from one his favourite CD's and are obviously strictly copyrighted to the producer and owner.

Artwork is made from my own custom creation and using purchased assets from:

This code is a couple of years old now, so could do with some updating to support latest iOS versions, screen/display sizes and remove any deprecated code.

Biggup my man in Nepal, Bala Badra Maharjan, for his work on this app.
